# Next.js Full-Stack Project with NextAuth üåê

This repository showcases a comprehensive project built using the latest version of **Next.js** with **NextAuth** for authentication. It provides an in-depth understanding of how to integrate authentication in Next.js applications, focusing on security, scalability, and efficiency.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è  
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering, routing, and building a seamless React-based application.  
- **NextAuth.js**: A complete authentication solution for Next.js, supporting various providers (Google, GitHub, Email, etc.).  
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better code maintainability.  
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval.  
- **Mailtrap**: Used for testing email functionalities without spamming real inboxes.  

## Features ‚ú®  
- **Authentication with NextAuth.js**: Easily integrate various authentication providers (Google, GitHub, Email, etc.).  
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) for better SEO and performance.  
- Fully typed codebase using **TypeScript** for improved developer experience.  
- Integration with **MongoDB** for persistent data storage, especially for session handling and user data.  
- Secure email testing with **Mailtrap** for registration and authentication flow.  
- Modern design patterns and best practices in Next.js and authentication.

## What I Learned üìù  
- Setting up **NextAuth.js** for authentication in a Next.js app.  
- Configuring different authentication providers (Google, GitHub, etc.) in NextAuth.  
- Managing sessions and secure user authentication.  
- Using **API routes** in Next.js to handle authentication-related tasks.  
- Integrating **MongoDB** to store session and user data securely.  
- Creating secure and efficient **email workflows** with **Mailtrap** for user registration and password reset flows.
